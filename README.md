👋 Hey there, I'm an independent developer with a passion for crafting web and mobile applications. My playground? JavaScript, especially React for web and Expo for mobile projects. I love coding in VSCode, my steadfast companion on all my development adventures.

🚀 On my GitHub, you'll find all my current and future projects. It's my personal lab where I experiment with ideas and hone my skills. My goal? To make development my full-time career and continue exploring the vast universe of programming.

🌱 Naturally curious, I'm always on the lookout for new languages and technologies. Learning something new? That's my morning coffee! I thrive on challenges and stepping out of my comfort zone.

💬 Feel free to explore my repos and reach out to discuss ideas or collaborations. Together, let's explore the endless possibilities of coding!
